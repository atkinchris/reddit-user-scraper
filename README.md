# Reddit User Image Scraper

Scrapes Reddit user submissions for their main images

## Disclaimer

This is rough and functional, and was created to automate personal tasks. It is not a good example of how to write a Node application.

## Usage

Requires Node 10+.

Put an array of usernames in `users.json`.

```json
["user1", "user2", "user3"]
```

Run the following commands. Images will appear in `images` directory.

```sh
npm install
node index.js
```
